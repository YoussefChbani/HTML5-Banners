🎬 Slide Breakdown
This deck is designed to narrate a specific brand story for The AA and Cention.

Slide 1: Global Reach (Cention)
Visuals: Parallax background, floating particles, and a glowing "Get Started" button.

Concept: Introduces Cention's AI-driven solutions. The "Floating" and "Wavy" animations on the logo create a sense of fluidity and seamless connection.

Slide 2: The Beacon (The AA)
Visuals: A scanning light beam cutting through the dark with a "ghostly" large typography effect.

Concept: "Always Ahead." Represents The AA as a guiding light. It positions the brand not just as a mechanic service, but as a guardian that provides safety and direction in the dark.

Slide 3: The Pulse (Vixa)
Visuals: A 3D rotating core engine built with CSS borders and perspective transforms. Live "scrolling grid" background.

Concept: "The Pulse of Your Car." Focuses on "Vixa" (Connected Car technology). The rotating rings and data stats visualize the 24/7 active monitoring and live diagnostics of the vehicle.

Slide 4: The Patrol (Service)
Visuals: The screen is dark until the user moves their mouse. A "torch" beam reveals the underlying content.

Concept: "Here For You." An interactive metaphor for a patrol officer arriving at night. It reinforces the human element of roadside assistance, proving that help is always there when you look for it.

You can easily adjust the primary theme colors by editing the :root variables at the top of style.css:
